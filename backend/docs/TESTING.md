# Snyder - Testing Guide

This guide provides a set of URLs and instructions to test the various functionalities of the **Snyder** Express.js
application. Use this document to verify that all features are working as expected after any changes or updates.

---

### üîó **Testing URLs**

Below are the URLs categorized based on their functionalities. Replace `your_query` with your desired search term and
`:videoId` with the actual YouTube video ID.
Ensure your server is running and environment variables are correctly configured before testing.

---

#### 1. **Authentication Routes**

##### a. **Initiate Spotify Authentication**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify`
- **Description:** Redirects the user to Spotify's authentication page. After successful authentication, Spotify will
  redirect back to your application via the callback URL (`/auth/spotify/callback`).

##### b. **Spotify Callback Route**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback`
- **Description:** Spotify redirects to this route after the user completes authentication. This route handles the
  authentication response and redirects the user to the dashboard.

##### c. **Logout Route**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/logout`
- **Description:** Logs out the authenticated user, destroys the session, and redirects them to the home page (`/`).

---

#### 2. **Unified Search Endpoint**

##### a. **Perform a Unified Search**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=your_query`
- **Description:** Performs a search using the query parameter `q`. Depending on the enabled integrations (
  `ENABLE_SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION` and `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION`), it fetches results from Spotify and/or YouTube and
  returns a unified JSON response.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=Imagine%20Dragons
  ```

---

#### 3. **Spotify-Specific Search Endpoint**

> **Note:** This endpoint is available **only if** `ENABLE_SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION=true` in your environment variables.

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/search?q=your_query`
- **Description:** Fetches search results exclusively from Spotify based on the provided query parameter `q`.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/search?q=Imagine%20Dragons
  ```

---

#### 4. **YouTube-Specific Search Endpoint**

> **Note:** This endpoint is available **only if** `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION=true` in your environment variables.

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/youtube/search?q=your_query`
- **Description:** Fetches search results exclusively from YouTube based on the provided query parameter `q`.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/youtube/search?q=Imagine%20Dragons
  ```

---

#### 5. **YouTube Video Details Endpoint**

> **Note:** This endpoint is available **only if** `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION=true` in your environment variables.

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/youtube/details/:videoId`
- **Description:** Retrieves detailed information about a specific YouTube video using its `videoId`. The response
  includes video metadata such as title, description, thumbnails, duration, and statistics like likes and view counts.
  Depending on the `ENABLE_CACHE` setting, the response may be served from the cache or fetched directly from the
  YouTube API.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/youtube/details/dQw4w9WgXcQ
  ```
- **Example Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "title": "Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Video)",
    "duration": "PT3M33S",
    "thumbnails": {
      "maxres": {
        "url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg",
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720
      }
    },
    "likes": 1000000,
    "viewCount": 1000000000,
    "dislikes": 20000
  }
  ```

---

#### 6. **Default Route**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/`
- **Description:** Displays a welcome message indicating that the backend of the Snyder app is running.

---

#### 7. **Test Routes** *(Available Only in Development Mode)*

##### a. **Fetch Configuration Details**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/config`
- **Description:** Returns configuration details such as port number, Spotify client IDs, and YouTube API keys.
- **Condition:** Available only if `NODE_ENV=development` and `ENABLE_AUTH_ROUTES=true`.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/config
  ```

##### b. **Access Protected Dashboard**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- **Description:** A protected route that returns a welcome message along with the authenticated user's information.
- **Condition:** Accessible only to authenticated users in development mode.
- **Example:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/dashboard
  ```

---

#### 8. **Caching Toggle**

- **Environment Variable:** `ENABLE_CACHE`
- **Description:** Controls whether caching is enabled for API responses. Set to `true` to enable caching, which will
  store responses in Redis for faster subsequent access. Set to `false` to disable caching, ensuring all responses are
  fetched directly from the source APIs.
- **Impact:**
    - **When Enabled (`ENABLE_CACHE=true`):**
        - Responses from `/api/search`, `/api/spotify/search`, `/api/youtube/search`, and
          `/api/youtube/details/:videoId` may be served from the cache.
        - Reduces latency and minimizes redundant API calls.
        - Log messages will indicate cache hits and misses.
    - **When Disabled (`ENABLE_CACHE=false`):**
        - All responses are fetched directly from Spotify and YouTube APIs.
        - No cache hits or misses are recorded.
        - Redis connection is not established, saving resources.
- **Example:**
    - **Enable Caching:**
      ```env
      ENABLE_CACHE=true
      ```
    - **Disable Caching:**
      ```env
      ENABLE_CACHE=false
      ```

---

#### 9. **Error Handling**

- **Scenario:** If you attempt to access the `/api/search` endpoint without any integrations enabled (
  `ENABLE_SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION=false` and `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION=false`), you'll receive a `503 Service Unavailable`
  error with the message:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "No integrations are enabled for search"
  }
  ```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Additional Testing Considerations**

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Ensure that all necessary environment variables (`ENABLE_CACHE`, `ENABLE_SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION`,
      `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION`, etc.) are correctly set in your `.env` file.
    - Restart the server after making changes to environment variables to apply the new configurations.

- **Authentication Flow:**
    - To perform searches that require user authentication (e.g., Spotify searches), ensure that you've successfully
      authenticated via Spotify by accessing `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify` before making search requests.
- **Redis Connection:**
    - When `ENABLE_CACHE=true`, ensure that your Redis service (e.g., Upstash) is running and accessible.
    - Properly configure the `REDIS_URL` in your `.env` file with your Redis service credentials.

- **Testing Tools:**
    - **Browser:** Directly access the URLs via your web browser.
    - **API Clients:** Utilize tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to
      craft and send HTTP requests, especially useful for testing various scenarios and headers.

- **Logging:**
    - Monitor your server's console output to observe the flow of requests, successful operations, and any potential
      errors. Winston logging provides detailed insights for debugging and verification.

- **Graceful Shutdown:**
    - When terminating the server (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`), the application will gracefully disconnect from Redis if
      caching is enabled, preventing potential resource leaks.

### üìö **Best Practices for Testing**

1. **Sequential Testing:**
    - Start by testing authentication routes to ensure users can log in and log out successfully.
    - Proceed to test the unified search endpoint with various queries to verify data aggregation from enabled
      integrations.

2. **Conditional Testing:**
    - Toggle `ENABLE_SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION`, `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_INTEGRATION` and `ENABLE_CACHE` to `true` or `false` and observe how the
      `/search` and other endpoints respond.
    - Ensure that the application gracefully handles disabled integrations without crashing.

3. **Error Simulation:**
    - Intentionally cause errors (e.g., invalid API keys) to test the application's error handling and logging
      mechanisms.
    - Verify that appropriate error messages are returned to the client and logged internally.

4. **Rate Limiting:**
    - Exceed the rate limits for Spotify, YouTube, or search endpoints to ensure that rate limiting is enforced and
      handled correctly.
    - Observe the logged warnings and error messages when rate limits are hit.

5. **Performance Testing:**
    - Conduct load testing on the `/search` endpoint to assess how the application handles multiple simultaneous
      requests.
    - Monitor response times and resource utilization to identify potential bottlenecks.

6. **Security Testing:**
    - Verify that protected routes (e.g., `/dashboard`) are inaccessible without proper authentication.
    - Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through endpoints like `/config`.
