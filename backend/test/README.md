# Test Module

This directory contains routes and controllers used for testing purposes during development.

- `testRoutes.js`: Defines testing routes, such as `/config` and `/dashboard`.
- `testController.js`: Handles the logic for testing routes.
- `index.js`: Exports modules for easy import elsewhere in the application.

**Note**: These routes are only active in development mode and should not be used in production.
