# Spotify Module
This directory contains all Spotify-related code, including routes, controllers, services, and client credential management for interacting with the Spotify API.

- `spotifyRoutes.js`: Defines routes for Spotify API endpoints, such as the search route.
- `spotifyController.js`: Handles the logic for Spotify routes, including the search functionality.
- `spotifyService.js`: Contains the business logic for interacting with the Spotify API, including handling the search queries.
- `spotifyClientCredentials.js`: Manages Spotify API tokens using the Client Credentials Flow, including token retrieval and expiration handling.
- `index.js`: Exports the Spotify-related modules for easy import elsewhere in the application.

## Key Features
- **Spotify Search**: Allows searching for music on Spotify using the `/api/spotify/search?q=your_query` endpoint.
- **Client Credentials Flow**: Handles API authentication using Spotify's Client Credentials Flow, ensuring secure access to the Spotify API.
- **Token Management**: Manages access token lifecycle, ensuring that tokens are refreshed when they expire.
- **Unified API Integration**: Integrates Spotify API calls into the app and aggregates data with other services (like YouTube) when needed.

## Example Usage:
- To search for a query on Spotify:
  `GET /api/spotify/search?q=your_query`

  This returns a list of music tracks from Spotify that match the search query.

This module provides all the functionality required to interact with the Spotify API, including music search, token management, and API requests.
